name: 'AutoKoopman: A Toolbox for Automated System Identification via Koopman Operator
  Linearization'
description: While Koopman operator linearization has brought many advances for prediction,
  control, and verification of dynamical systems, its main disadvantage is that the
  quality of the resulting model heavily depends on the correct tuning of hyper-parameters
  such as the number of observables. Our AutoKoopman toolbox is a Python package that
  automates learning accurate models in a Koopman linearized representation at low
  effort, offering several tuning strategies to optimize the hyper-parameters associated
  with the Koopman operator techniques automatically.  AutoKoopman supports discrete
  as well as continuous-time models and implements all major types of observables,
  which are polynomials, random Fourier features, and neural networks. As we demonstrate
  on several benchmarks, our toolbox is able to automatically identify very accurate
  dynamic models for symbolic, black-box, as well as real systems.
